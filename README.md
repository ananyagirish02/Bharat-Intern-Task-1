# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
 The aim of the project was to develop a model that could accurately estimate the prices of houses based on various features.

 ## Overview
+ Loading and exploring the dataset
+ Data preprocessing: handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
+ Feature analysis and visualization
+ Training the linear regression model
+ Model evaluation using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 score

## Results

+ Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 87574.47
+ Mean Squared Error (MSE): 21314373902.93
+ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):145994.431
+ R2 score: 0.83
